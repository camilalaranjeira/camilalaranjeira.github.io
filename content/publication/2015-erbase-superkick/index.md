abstract: This article describes the development of a long-range kick, the superkick, for soccer player of the RoboCup 3D Simulation League. This strategy was adopted in order to achieve competitive advantage over other teams, focusing mainly on kickoff situations for the allied team, taking advantage of a guaranteed possesion of the ball to score. This work had very positive results and is expected to put BahiaRT among the best teams in the world in the next edition of RoboCup.
